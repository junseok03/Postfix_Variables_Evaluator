# Evaluator for expressions with variables

This is a project for evaluating expressions with variables.

## How to use:

- Set two variables with integers (the input should be space-separated)
  - (i.e. A 3 =)
- After defining variables, write an expression in postfix format (the input should be comma-separated)
  - (i.e. A,B,*)
